How many weapons that you chose correctly from the rack, 
    regardless of whether it was used against the correct gladiator 
    (i.e. it might be used against another gladiator)
How many weapons were used against the correct gladiator

An observant soldier can use this information wisely, 
    and will quickly be able to determine the correct attack sequence.

A sample attack sequence will look like this: [3,2,5,0]
NOTE: actually two lists [3,2,5,0] and [0,1,2,3] because the postion counts as a second list 


Which means that you will attack 
gladiator #1 with weapon #3, 
gladiator #2 with weapon #2, 
gladiator #3 with weapon #5, 
gladiator #4 with weapon #0.

After each attack attempt, I will respond by telling you 
how many weapons you chose correctly, and 
how many weapons you used against the correct gladiator.

Each response will look like this: [2,1]

Which means that 
two weapons were chosen correctly from the rack, but that 
only one weapon was used against the correct gladiator.
